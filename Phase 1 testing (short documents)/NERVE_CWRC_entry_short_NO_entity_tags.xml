            <HEADING SUBTYPE="2">Sara Jeannette Duncan (1861-1922)</HEADING>
            <P>Sarah Janet Duncan was born on 22 December 1861, the eldest of nine surviving
                children of Charles Duncan (1834-1907) and Jane ("Jeannie") Bell (1837-1931). She
                enjoyed a prosperous upbringing due to her father's success as a merchant. She first
                attended Central School and Brantford Ladies College, and then trained as a teacher
                at the Brant County Model school, earning her third-class teaching certificate in
                1879. She taught school in the Brantford area from 1880 to 1882.</P>
            <P>Her first published prose piece, "Diogenes on Bric-a-Brac," appeared in The Canadian
                Monthly and National Review in June 1880.<BIBCITS>
                    <BIBCIT
                        REF="http://commons.cwrc.ca/islandora:8b2de07f-7b41-4cf3-b458-292a4a06f0bc"
                    />
                </BIBCITS> With an early desire to distinguish herself in literature, she chose to
                pursue a journalistic career, establishing herself with articles about the New
                Orleans Cotton Centennial of 1884 in the London Advertiser (Ontario), the Toronto
                Globe, and the Memphis Appeal. She left New Orleans in May 1885 in order to work in
                a variety of journalistic roles, including some occasional writing for the Globe and
                full-time work on the Washington Post from October 1885 until the spring of 1886.
                She became one of Canada's first regular woman journalists with a daily column in
                the Globe, entitled "Woman's World," and later wrote a similar column,
                "Bric-a-Brac," for the Montreal Star. Working at the Star from the fall of 1887, she
                was made the Star's parliamentary correspondent in Ottawa in March 1888. She
                continued to contribute to periodicals such as The Week, where she used the pen name
                "Garth Grafton."</P>
            <P>Having altered her name to what she considered the more sophisticated "Sara
                Jeannette," she published her first novel, A Social Departure, in 1890. The novel
                originated as a series of travel sketches written for the Montreal Star in 1888-89,
                as she travelled around the world with fellow journalist, Lily Lewis. In India, Sara
                met Everard Cotes, a Calcutta museum official who later became a newspaper editor
                and Reuters correspondent. Sara completed her journey, staying with Everard's
                relatives in England before returning to Brantford. In the autumn of 1890, Sara
                travelled back to Calcutta, where she married Everard, in St. Thomas's (Free School)
                Church, on 6 December 1890.</P>
            <P>Duncan subsequently published serious and comic fiction set mainly in England and
                India, much of it concerned with Anglo-Indian social and political situations. Many
                of her novels, especially her earlier works, were first serialized in British and
                American journals (notably The Lady's Pictorial and the American edition of the
                Illustrated London News). </P>
            <P>In keeping with the custom of the British in India, the Cotes shared their time
                between Calcutta and Simla, a small Himalayan town that became the headquarters of
                British administration each year during the hot season. During her time in India,
                Sara frequently visited England for extended periods, spending almost as much time
                in London as in India. She also travelled home to Canada a number of times. Living
                in Canada, India, and England gave her a unique perspective on issues of empire,
                both social and political. In the late 1890s, Sara contracted tuberculosis and spent
                months in her Simla garden, exiled from the house, writing a reflective novel on the
                experience: The Crow's Nest (1901; published in England as On the Other Side of the
                Latch).</P>
            <P>Only two of her twenty-two novels deal with Canada: The Imperialist (1904) presents a
                serious analysis of Canadian identity, while Cousin Cinderella (1908; originally
                intended to be titled A Canadian Girl in London) takes a lighter look at
                international social relations. In her later years, Sara wrote plays, many of which
                were performed, but all of which remain unpublished. She retired with her husband to
                Chelsea, in London, then to Ashtead, Surrey, where she died of pneumonia on 22 July
                1922. She was buried in St. Giles churchyard, in Ashtead, on 26 July 1922.</P>

                Biography.</P>
