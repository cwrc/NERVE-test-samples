                                that French Canada often figures largely in these works, especially

                            eighteenth century, Frances Brooke may be said to have originated the
                            genre in The History of Emily Montague (1769), set contemporaneously for
                            Brooke, in Quebec shortly after the <ref target="#theme_or_topic"

                            the interest of English-Canadian writers came to be focused intently and
                            insistently upon this point in Canadian history, a time which, in these
                            writers' works, provided the country with its own romantic and Gothic

                                    difference: the novels by men that rose to prominence—like
                                    William Kirby's The Golden Dog (1877), Gilbert Parker's The
                                    Seats of the Mighty (1896), and John Lespérance's The Bastonnais
                                    (1876)—invested heavily in documented events and historical
                                    figures, providing a fictional behind-the-scenes look at the
                                    personal intrigue and military engagements in the fall of New
                                    France. These authors were praised by reviewers for the
                                    pedagogical value of their works, and Parker's became a standard
                                    high school text (Rothenburger 91). <ref target="#women_writing"

                                    set in final years of New France, traces both the romantic
                                    choices of the heroine and the battlefield efforts of her
                                    suitor, the emphasis falls on the former, and Leprohon followed
                                    this novel with her better-known work, Antoinette De Mirecourt
                                    (1864), set immediately post-Conquest, in which the battlefield
                                    has moved decidedly into the drawing room.</ref>

                                works by women have not garnered equivalent recognition. But a
                                renewed scholarly interest in these works, especially in the light
                                of Gothic analysis, reveals their importance in articulating some of
                                literary Canada's most pressing concerns of the nineteenth century:
                                the country's relationship with its European mother countries, the
                                vexed relationship between English and French Canada, and the
                                importance of the country's shared understanding of (and imaginative
                                involvement in) how its history informs its present. Manifest in
                                these works is a Gothic exploration of the <ref

                        identification with French Canada, despite the apparent contradiction of

                        narratives that cast English Canada and its British forbears as the
                        oppressive force, there is a discernible strain of criticism whereby these
                        works implicitly question and critique the historical foundations and
                        perhaps by extension the present-day establishment of the dominant English

                        though, Gothic modes lend themselves to the expression of otherwise
                        suppressed feelings of alienation, ambivalence, and trauma. These writers
                        adapted the Gothic to the complexities of their literary nationalism, and it
                        is this version of Canadian Gothic that I wish to explore. </ref></p>

                            foundation for a unique national literature. Nonetheless, by classifying

                            (106) and that <q>the English-Canadian Gothic tradition begins in the
                                mid-nineteenth century with Canadian-born John Richardson's
                                nightmarish historical romance, Wacousta; or, The Prophesy: A Tale
                                of the Canadas (1832) and Susanna Moodie's non-fictional immigrant
                                memoir Roughing It in the Bush; or Life in Canada (1852)</q> (105).
                            Justin D. Edwards also posits Wacousta as <q>arguably Canada's first
                                Gothic novel</q> (2), and Margot Northey's treatment of the novel in
                            her book The Haunted Wilderness underscores the centrality of wilderness
                            in these explanations of Canadian Gothic. Wacousta, then, perhaps more
                            than any other text, has influenced the emergence and articulation of a
                            Canadian Gothic tradition, as well as the direction and definition of
                            this debated body of literature. But has the emphasis on Wacousta and
                            wilderness Gothic obscured other dimensions of Canadian Gothic? Works
                            that share the wilderness Gothic theme, such as Roughing It in the Bush,
                            are easily incorporated into the tradition presided over by Wacousta,
                            but other texts to receive sustained critical attention are relatively
                            few. Northey treats Kirby's The Golden Dog at length as <q>decorative
                                Gothic,</q> and Kirby's work is often paired with Parker's The Seats
                            of the Mighty. Gerry Turcotte joins Edwards in devoting in-depth
                            attention to James De Mille's A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper
                            Cylinder. Apart from Moodie, though, few women writers have received
                            extended critical attention in the context of nineteenth-century
                            Canadian Gothic. And <ref target="#genre_issue">this is perhaps
                                explained in part by the differences between the <ref
                                    target="#genre">wilderness Gothic</ref> of Wacousta that has
                                defined the genre and the conventions of domestic romance that shape
                                the Gothicism of English Canada's women writers. </ref>Turning their
                            attention not to the wilderness but instead to a French Canada both
                            civilized and sophisticated in its social arrangements, <ref
                                target="#textual_strategies">these novels turn to Gothic
                                modes—evident in narrative moments of ambivalence, anxiety, excess,
                                and the uncanny—to explore and imagine a Canada felt to be both
                                familiar and foreign, intensely sympathetic, yet habitually
                                estranged.</ref>
                            <ref target="#methodology">I would like to bring the insights of Gothic

                                the critical development of Canadian Gothic itself, a body of
                                literature perhaps more various than has yet been observed.</ref>
