But it is in the nineteenth century that the interest of English-Canadian writers came to be focused intently and insistently upon this point in Canadian history, a time which, in these writers' works, provided the country with its own romantic and Gothic past.</ref></ref> </p>
              <p xml:id="p213"> <ref target="#nationality_issue"><ref target="#response_gendered"><ref target="#genre_novel"><ref target="#history">Although the <ref target="#theme_or_topic">historical <placeName cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6115047">Quebec</placeName></ref> setting seems to have appealed equally to male and female writers, both of whom drew upon Gothic modes, there is an observable difference: the novels by men that rose to prominence—like <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/79252548">William Kirby</persName>'s <title level="m" cert="probable" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/310937533">The Golden Dog</title> (<date cert="definite" when="1877">1877</date>), <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/30652438">Gilbert Parker</persName>'s <title level="m">The Seats of the Mighty</title> (<date cert="definite" when="1896">1896</date>), and <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/70558556">John Lespérance</persName>'s <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/309450560">The Bastonnais</title> (<date cert="definite" when="1876">1876</date>)—invested heavily in documented events and historical figures, providing a fictional behind-the-scenes look at the personal intrigue and military engagements in the fall of New France. These authors were praised by reviewers for the pedagogical value of their works, and Parker's became a standard high school text (<persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/102769745" sameAs="Sunnie Rothenburger">Rothenburger</persName> 91). <ref target="#women_writing">Women writers also recreated pre- and post-Conquest Quebec, but their narratives tended to place more emphasis on courtship and <ref target="#theme_or_topic">family drama</ref> than on battlefield incident.</ref> Although <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/205196210">Rosanna Leprohon</persName>'s novel <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/311457338">The Manor House of de Villerai</title> (<date cert="definite" when="1860">1860</date>), set in final years of New France, traces both the romantic choices of the heroine and the battlefield efforts of her suitor, the emphasis falls on the former, and Leprohon followed this novel with her better-known work, <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/311457169">Antoinette De Mirecourt</title> (<date when="1864" cert="definite">1864</date>), set immediately post-Conquest, in which the battlefield has moved decidedly into the drawing room.</ref> <ref target="#politics">These works of <ref target="#genre">domestic romance</ref> nonetheless represent, with equal emphasis to the works by male authors, the politics of English–French conflict that lie at the heart of <placeName cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6251999">Canada</placeName>'s national self-formation</ref>. Without the glorified textbook incident so prominent in the fiction of their male counterparts, however, the works by women have not garnered equivalent recognition. But a renewed scholarly interest in these works, especially in the light of Gothic analysis, reveals their importance in articulating some of literary Canada's most pressing concerns of the nineteenth century: the country's relationship with its European mother countries, the vexed relationship between English and French Canada, and the importance of the country's shared understanding of (and imaginative involvement in) how its history informs its present. Manifest in these works is a Gothic exploration of the <ref target="#theme_or_topic">divided self</ref>, which unfolds, in uniquely Canadian fashion, amidst the complexities of the country's French and English <ref target="#theme_or_topic">colonial legacies</ref>.</ref></ref></ref> </p>
              <p xml:id="p214"><ref target="#women_writing"><ref target="#genre_issue">While the fall of New France afforded a setting primed for the dramatic intrigue typical of <ref target="#genre">Gothic romance</ref>, the <q>othering</q> one would expect from English writers depicting French society is consistently muted or doubled—at least in women's writing—with a strong sense of sympathy and identification that belies any simple project of romantic exoticism.</ref> One discovers in this fiction that English-Canadian women writers felt a deep sense of identification with French Canada, despite the apparent contradiction of this English–French positioning.</ref><ref target="#historical_oppression">Indeed, by placing their fictions in the context of New France under British attack, these writers could explore subjectivities vulnerable to complex forms of political as well as personal victimization. And in narratives that cast English Canada and its British forbears as the oppressive force, there is a discernible strain of criticism whereby these works implicitly question and critique the historical foundations and perhaps by extension the present-day establishment of the dominant English culture.</ref></p>
              <p xml:id="p215"> <ref target="#nationality_issue">This analysis centres on four texts: <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/5193747">Frances Brooke</persName>'s <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/309259314">The History of Emily Montague</title> (1769), commonly referred to as <placeName cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6251999">Canada</placeName>'s first novel; <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/76384880">Julia Catherine Beckwith</persName>'s <title level="m">St. Ursula's Convent, Or the Nun of Canada. Containing Scenes From Real Life</title> (<date cert="definite" when="1824">1824</date>), considered to be the first novel by a Canadian-born writer; <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/205196210">Rosanna Leprohon</persName>'s <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/311457169">Antoinette De Mirecourt</title> (<date cert="definite" when="1864">1864</date>), written just prior to <listEvent>

These writers adapted the Gothic to the complexities of their literary nationalism, and it is this version of Canadian Gothic that I wish to explore. </ref></p>

                    </listEvent> anxieties about Canada's dubious cultural distinctiveness, these explanations make sense of English Canada's desire to celebrate, even to construct, a rich cultural heritage that could provide the foundation for a unique national literature. Nonetheless, by classifying these romances of Old <placeName cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6115047">Quebec</placeName> as symptoms of national self-doubt, these explanations perhaps overlook some of the creative possibilities in the writing and reading of this body of literature. <ref target="#response_informal"><persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/44478665">Misao Dean</persName> confirms that critical opinion has not favoured these works, noting that <q>although romances like <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/311457169" sameAs="Antoinette De Mirecourt">Antoinette [De Mirecourt]</title> and <title level="m" cert="probable" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/310937533">The Golden Dog</title> dominated the literary scene in Canada in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they are generally dismissed by contemporary Canadian critics as examples of an inferior literary form not worthy of sustained critical attention</q> (44). </ref>She further explains that this is especially evident in the case of <title level="m">Antoinette De Mirecourt</title>. <ref target="#response_formal">Speaking of <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/205196210" sameAs="Rosanna Leprohon">Leprohon</persName>'s series of Quebec novels, <persName cert="probable" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/93288616">John Stockdale</persName> in the <title level="m">Dictionary of Canadian Biography</title> says of <title level="m">Antoinette</title>, <q>This is a romantic, stilted novel, the worst of the later group,</q> and of Leprohon's body of work, he writes, it is <q>obviously the outpouring of a romantic fancy fed on the novels of her time</q> (n. pag.)</ref> Stockdale's assessment reflects the dismissive attitude toward <ref target="#genre">romance</ref> that has worked to the detriment of Canada's nineteenth-century fiction of national romance in general, and women's offerings within that tradition in particular. </ref></ref></ref></p>
              <p xml:id="p217"> <ref target="#women_writing"><ref target="#genre_issue">The place of women's writing in the development of <ref target="#theme_or_topic"><placeName cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6251999">Canada</placeName>'s Gothic literature</ref> is also a matter of some debate. Studies of nineteenth-century Canadian Gothic have tended to agree with <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/93675286">Coral Ann Howells</persName> that <q>the first Canadian Gothic was wilderness Gothic</q> (106) and that <q>the English-Canadian Gothic tradition begins in the mid-nineteenth century with Canadian-born <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/39386255">John Richardson</persName>'s nightmarish historical romance, <title level="m">Wacousta; or, The Prophesy: A Tale of the Canadas</title> (<date cert="definite" when="1832">1832</date>) and <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/20989">Susanna Moodie</persName>'s non-fictional immigrant memoir <title level="m">Roughing It in the Bush; or Life in Canada</title> (<date cert="definite" when="1852">1852</date>)</q> (105). <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/116861733">Justin D. Edwards</persName> also posits <title level="m">Wacousta</title> as <q>arguably Canada's first Gothic novel</q> (2), and <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/117980066">Margot Northey</persName>'s treatment of the novel in her book <title level="m">The Haunted Wilderness</title> underscores the centrality of wilderness in these explanations of Canadian Gothic. <title level="m">Wacousta</title>, then, perhaps more than any other text, has influenced the emergence and articulation of a Canadian Gothic tradition, as well as the direction and definition of this debated body of literature. But has the emphasis on <title level="m">Wacousta</title> and wilderness Gothic obscured other dimensions of Canadian Gothic? Works that share the wilderness Gothic theme, such as <title level="m">Roughing It in the Bush</title>, are easily incorporated into the tradition presided over by <title level="m">Wacousta</title>, but other texts to receive sustained critical attention are relatively few. Northey treats <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/79252548" sameAs="William Kirby">Kirby</persName>'s <title level="m" cert="probable" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/310937533">The Golden Dog</title> at length as <q>decorative Gothic,</q> and Kirby's work is often paired with <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/30652438" sameAs="Gilbert Parker">Parker</persName>'s <title level="m">The Seats of the Mighty</title>. <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/43473203">Gerry Turcotte</persName> joins Edwards in devoting in-depth attention to <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/62350932">James De Mille</persName>'s <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/310214485">A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder</title>. Apart from Moodie, though, few women writers have received extended critical attention in the context of nineteenth-century Canadian Gothic. And <ref target="#genre_issue">this is perhaps explained in part by the differences between the <ref target="#genre">wilderness Gothic</ref> of <title level="m">Wacousta</title> that has defined the genre and the conventions of domestic romance that shape the Gothicism of English Canada's women writers. </ref>Turning their attention not to the wilderness but instead to a French Canada both civilized and sophisticated in its social arrangements, <ref target="#textual_strategies">these novels turn to Gothic modes—evident in narrative moments of ambivalence, anxiety, excess, and the uncanny—to explore and imagine a Canada felt to be both familiar and foreign, intensely sympathetic, yet habitually estranged.</ref> <ref target="#methodology">I would like to bring the insights of Gothic analysis to bear on some of English Canada's nineteenth-century women writers, and I would like in turn to place their works within the critical development of Canadian Gothic itself, a body of literature perhaps more various than has yet been observed.</ref> </ref></ref></p>
