These authors were praised by reviewers for the pedagogical value of their works, and Parker's became a standard high school text (<persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/102769745" sameAs="Sunnie Rothenburger">Rothenburger</persName> 91). <ref target="#women_writing">Women writers also recreated pre- and post-Conquest Quebec, but their narratives tended to place more emphasis on courtship and <ref target="#theme_or_topic">family drama</ref> than on battlefield incident.</ref> Although <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/205196210">Rosanna Leprohon</persName>'s novel <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/311457338">The Manor House of de Villerai</title> (<date cert="definite" when="1860">1860</date>), set in final years of New France, traces both the romantic choices of the heroine and the battlefield efforts of her suitor, the emphasis falls on the former, and Leprohon followed this novel with her better-known work, <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/311457169">Antoinette De Mirecourt</title> (<date when="1864" cert="definite">1864</date>), set immediately post-Conquest, in which the battlefield has moved decidedly into the drawing room.</ref> <ref target="#politics">These works of <ref target="#genre">domestic romance</ref> nonetheless represent, with equal emphasis to the works by male authors, the politics of English–French conflict that lie at the heart of <placeName cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6251999">Canada</placeName>'s national self-formation</ref>. Without the glorified textbook incident so prominent in the fiction of their male counterparts, however, the works by women have not garnered equivalent recognition. But a renewed scholarly interest in these works, especially in the light of Gothic analysis, reveals their importance in articulating some of literary Canada's most pressing concerns of the nineteenth century: the country's relationship with its European mother countries, the vexed relationship between English and French Canada, and the importance of the country's shared understanding of (and imaginative involvement in) how its history informs its present. Manifest in these works is a Gothic exploration of the <ref target="#theme_or_topic">divided self</ref>, which unfolds, in uniquely Canadian fashion, amidst the complexities of the country's French and English <ref target="#theme_or_topic">colonial legacies</ref>.</ref></ref></ref> </p>

And in narratives that cast English Canada and its British forbears as the oppressive force, there is a discernible strain of criticism whereby these works implicitly question and critique the historical foundations and perhaps by extension the present-day establishment of the dominant English culture.</ref></p>

Nonetheless, by classifying these romances of Old <placeName cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6115047">Quebec</placeName> as symptoms of national self-doubt, these explanations perhaps overlook some of the creative possibilities in the writing and reading of this body of literature. <ref target="#response_informal"><persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/44478665">Misao Dean</persName> confirms that critical opinion has not favoured these works, noting that <q>although romances like <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/311457169" sameAs="Antoinette De Mirecourt">Antoinette [De Mirecourt]</title> and <title level="m" cert="probable" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/310937533">The Golden Dog</title> dominated the literary scene in Canada in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they are generally dismissed by contemporary Canadian critics as examples of an inferior literary form not worthy of sustained critical attention</q> (44). </ref>She further explains that this is especially evident in the case of <title level="m">Antoinette De Mirecourt</title>. <ref target="#response_formal">Speaking of <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/205196210" sameAs="Rosanna Leprohon">Leprohon</persName>'s series of Quebec novels, <persName cert="probable" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/93288616">John Stockdale</persName> in the <title level="m">Dictionary of Canadian Biography</title> says of <title level="m">Antoinette</title>, <q>This is a romantic, stilted novel, the worst of the later group,</q> and of Leprohon's body of work, he writes, it is <q>obviously the outpouring of a romantic fancy fed on the novels of her time</q> (n. pag.)</ref> Stockdale's assessment reflects the dismissive attitude toward <ref target="#genre">romance</ref> that has worked to the detriment of Canada's nineteenth-century fiction of national romance in general, and women's offerings within that tradition in particular. </ref></ref></ref></p>

But has the emphasis on <title level="m">Wacousta</title> and wilderness Gothic obscured other dimensions of Canadian Gothic?

Apart from Moodie, though, few women writers have received extended critical attention in the context of nineteenth-century Canadian Gothic. And <ref target="#genre_issue">this is perhaps explained in part by the differences between the <ref target="#genre">wilderness Gothic</ref> of <title level="m">Wacousta</title> that has defined the genre and the conventions of domestic romance that shape the Gothicism of English Canada's women writers. </ref>Turning their attention not to the wilderness but instead to a French Canada both civilized and sophisticated in its social arrangements, <ref target="#textual_strategies">these novels turn to Gothic modes—evident in narrative moments of ambivalence, anxiety, excess, and the uncanny—to explore and imagine a Canada felt to be both familiar and foreign, intensely sympathetic, yet habitually estranged.</ref> <ref target="#methodology">I would like to bring the insights of Gothic analysis to bear on some of English Canada's nineteenth-century women writers, and I would like in turn to place their works within the critical development of Canadian Gothic itself, a body of literature perhaps more various than has yet been observed.</ref> </ref></ref></p>

Indeed, these two works direct a strong critique against representatives of the British in Canada; for these writers, the imaginative adoption of an embattled French-Canadian identity may have allowed them not only to deepen the gender politics of their narratives but also to express their ambivalence about the British legacy in their own culture, articulating a conflict at the very heart of the country they sought to inaugurate as a literary subject.</ref></ref> </p>

As though building upon this theme, Madame Des Roches takes him to visit a hermit, whose tale of love lost to Canada's hostile elements confirms the sense of threat and betrayal to be found in the Canadian wilds.</ref> This warning of the Gothic doom that waits on forbidden desires is quickly followed by the discovery of Madame Des Roches's deep but unrequited love for Rivers, which becomes a source of intense anxiety to that paragon of British sensibility, Emily Montague. </ref></ref></p>

Arabella and Emily both choose partners whose styles of love match their own, while Rivers's sister Lucy, who resembles her brother in sensibility, makes an unlikely match with long-time rake, John Temple. These unions, though various, nonetheless establish two major brands of love: the deep and constant love based upon sensibility (itself considered a British attribute), and the lively flirtatious love of the rake/coquet—both variations, in the right circumstances, forming the basis of happy marriages. Amidst these examples of love's various, and ultimately harmonious, guises, the feelings of Madame Des Roches strike a discordant note. For, rather than accommodating itself to the terms set out, her love defies the usual categories: though French, she is not given to playful flirtation; nor does her passion for Rivers resemble the ideal of sensibility embodied in Emily; rather, her unruly desires repeatedly prove unmanageable, inexplicable, and ultimately incompatible with matrimony. There is a degree of excess in her emotional life not matched by the other characters, which lends a Gothic texture to her characterization. <q>In Gothic productions,</q> argues <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/80546510">Fred Botting</persName>, <q>imagination and emotional effects exceed reason. Passion, excitement and sensation transgress social proprieties and moral laws.

Even though Madame Des Roches vows <q>to conquer a passion, which could only make her life wretched if it continued</q> (231), when she writes to Arabella over two months later, she has given up any such attempt: Arabella indirectly relates a letter in which Madame Des Roches vows, <q>she will never marry, nor enter into an engagement which would make it criminal in her to remember him with tenderness</q> (300). In fact, transcribing directly from this letter proves impossible even for outspoken Arabella, who admits that <q>there is a certain fire in her style,…her expressions are much stronger than those in which I have given you the sense of them</q> (300). And when she appears, still later, to see Arabella off on her return to England, her passion is still unquenched, so much so that penning a letter—the most important mode of communication in this epistolary work—proves next to impossible: <q>She has wrote four or five letters to him [Rivers], since she came on board, very tender ones I fancy, and destroyed them; she has at last wrote a mere complimentary kind of card, only thanking him for his offers of service</q> (325). <ref target="#religion">This card accompanies her wedding gifts for Rivers and Emily: a sword-knot and a diamond cross, which, as <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/30841837">Mary Jane Edwards</persName> speculates, bear connotations of war and Catholicism, leading one to wonder <q>whether open friendship or secret hatred was the true <q>child</q> of Madame Des Roches' rejected love</q> (25).</ref></ref> Where the protagonists share a debate about love's variety that culminates in their several harmonious unions, Madame Des Roches's feelings persistently outstrip the available limits and her story ends not in matrimony but in the vow that <q>she will live and die a batchelor</q> (431).</ref></ref> </p>

In <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/309259314" sameAs="The History of Emily Montague">Emily Montague</title>, marital bliss unites with carefully calculated inheritances to require a return to British ancestral estates; the representative inhabitant of <placeName cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6251999">Canada</placeName>, meanwhile, is left behind, alone forever in a state of Gothic irresolution. In <title level="m">St. Ursula's Convent</title>, though we see French–English unions celebrated enthusiastically and emblematically to heal the wounds revealed in embedded Gothic recitals of Canada's personal histories, <persName sameAs="Julia Catherine Beckwith" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/76384880">Beckwith</persName> hesitates at finding a home for her couples in Canada; European inheritances once again call characters home to Old World ancestral estates. <title level="m" cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/311457169">Antoinette De Mirecourt</title> does allow for a resolution on Canadian soil, once the poisonous Gothic version of the French–English union has been rejected and replaced by its reformed and benevolent mirror image. And in <title level="m">Kate Danton</title>, with <persName cert="definite" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/33401634" sameAs="May Agnes Fleming">Fleming</persName>'s suspicion of British titles and imperious ways, and her validation of homegrown Canadian ties, we see how, by the late nineteenth century, the cultural values at work in this self-consciously Canadian literary subgenre, though consistently influenced by colonial preoccupations, have shifted from strong imperial sentiment to decided national commitment.</ref></ref> These changing attitudes toward Canada's imperial ties in turn influence the representation of Canada's own internal duality. </ref></p>
                    <p xml:id="p237"> <ref target="#history"><ref target="#canon_formation">Writers of the nineteenth century were energetically engaged in the creation of a homegrown literature that would articulate the potential for a Canadian literary tradition,</ref> as well as explore an imaginatively rendered Canadian history. Looking to the British conquest of New France as the wellspring for this critical project created a fiction immersed in deeply felt cultural conflict and committed to the working through of traumatic colonial legacies.</ref> <ref target="#genre">English-Canadian women writers embraced this conflict and let it emerge in Gothic constructions, especially in the creation of carefully doubled and internally divided heroines, who expressed <placeName cert="definite" ref="http://www.geonames.org/6251999">Canada</placeName>'s inner conflicts through their trials as the protagonists of domestic romance.</ref> <ref target="#response_re-evaluation"><ref target="#response_formal">Though sustained literary recognition has, for the most part, eluded this body of fiction,</ref> when placed into conversation, these novels reveal an important side of Canada's literary development, particularly in the tradition of women's writing and Canadian Gothic. </ref></p>
